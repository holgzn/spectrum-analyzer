# Rust: library for frequency spectrum analysis using FFT
An easy to use and fast `no_std` library (with `alloc`) to get the frequency
spectrum of a digital signal (e.g. audio) using FFT.

The **MSRV** (minimum supported Rust version) is `1.61.0`.

## I want to understand how FFT can be used to get a spectrum
Please see file [/EDUCATIONAL.md](/EDUCATIONAL.md).

## How to use (including `no_std`-environments)
Most tips and comments are located inside the code, so please check out the
repository on GitHub! Anyway, the most basic usage looks like this:

### FFT implementation as compile time configuration via Cargo features
By default, this crate uses the `real`-module from the great `microfft`-crate.
It's the fastest implementation and as of version `v0.5.0` there should be no
valid reason why you should ever change this. The multiple features are there
mainly for educational reasons and to support me during programming/testing.

### Cargo.toml
```toml
# by default feature "microfft-real" is used
[dependencies]
spectrum-analyzer = "<latest version, see crates.io>"
```

### your_binary.rs
```rust
use spectrum_analyzer::{samples_fft_to_spectrum, FrequencyLimit};
use spectrum_analyzer::windows::hann_window;
use spectrum_analyzer::scaling::divide_by_N_sqrt;

/// Minimal example.
fn main() {
    // YOU need to implement the samples source; get microphone input for example
    let samples: &[f32] = &[0.0, 3.14, 2.718, -1.0, -2.0, -4.0, 7.0, 6.0];
    // apply hann window for smoothing; length must be a power of 2 for the FFT
    // 2048 is a good starting point with 44100 kHz
    let hann_window = hann_window(&samples[0..8]);
    // calc spectrum
    let spectrum_hann_window = samples_fft_to_spectrum(
        // (windowed) samples
        &hann_window,
        // sampling rate
        44100,
        // optional frequency limit: e.g. only interested in frequencies 50 <= f <= 150?
        FrequencyLimit::All,
        // optional scale
        Some(&divide_by_N_sqrt),
    ).unwrap();

    for (fr, fr_val) in spectrum_hann_window.data().iter() {
        println!("{}Hz => {}", fr, fr_val)
    }
}
```

## Performance
*Measurements taken on i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz (Single-threaded) with optimized build*

I've tested multiple FFT implementations. Below you can find out why I decided
to use `microfft`.

| Operation                                               | Time   |
|---------------------------------------------------------| ------:|
| Hann Window with 4096 samples                           | ≈68µs  |
| Hamming Window with 4096 samples                        | ≈118µs |
| FFT (`rustfft`) to spectrum with 4096 samples           | ≈170µs |
| FFT (`microfft::real`) to spectrum with 4096 samples    | ≈90µs  |
| FFT (`microfft::complex`) to spectrum with 4096 samples | ≈250µs |

## Example Visualizations
In the following examples you can see a basic visualization of the spectrum from `0 to 4000Hz` for
a layered signal of sine waves of `50`, `1000`, and `3777Hz` @ `44100Hz` sampling rate. The peaks for the
given frequencies are clearly visible. Each calculation was done with `2048` samples, i.e. ≈46ms of audio signal.

**The noise (wrong peaks) also comes from clipping of the added sine waves!**

### Spectrum *without window function* on samples
Peaks (50, 1000, 3777 Hz) are clearly visible but also some noise.

### Spectrum with *Hann window function* on samples before FFT
Peaks (50, 1000, 3777 Hz) are clearly visible and Hann window reduces noise a
little. Because this example has few noise, you don't see much difference.

## Live Audio + Spectrum Visualization
Execute example `$ cargo run --release --example live-visualization`. It will
show you how you can visualize audio data in realtime + the current spectrum.

## Building and Executing Tests
To execute tests you need the package `libfreetype6-dev` (on Ubuntu/Debian).
This is required because not all tests are "automatic unit tests" but also tests
that you need to check visually, by looking at the generated diagram of the
spectrum.

## Trivia / FAQ
### Why f64 and no f32?
I tested f64 but the additional accuracy doesn't pay out the ~40% calculation
overhead (on x86_64).
### What can I do against the noise?
Apply a window function, like Hann window or Hamming window.
