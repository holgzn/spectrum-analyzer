//! Abstraction over FFT implementation. This is mainly necessary because we might have
//! `no_std`/`std` implementations as well as real/complex implementations and especially
//! `real` FFT implementations might need a few adjustments.
//!
//! This crate compiles only iff exactly one feature, i.e. one FFT implementation, is activated.
//!
//! ## What FFT implementation to choose?
//! "microfft-real" should be in any way the fastest implementation and fine in any case.
//! I added multiple implementations primarily for educational reasons to myself to learn
//! differences between real and complex FFT. As of release 0.5.0 there is no valid case
//! why you should switch to another FFT implementation. They are primarily useful to me
//! during development to test different FFT implementations and see if my code is correct.
//!
//! ## Tips for development/testing
//! Usually I do all tests against "rustfft" because it is the
//! most actively developed implementation and also the fastest and most accurate, at least
//! in `std`-environments on modern processors. To test other implementations I usually
//! plot the results using the function
//! `crate::tests::test_spectrum_and_visualize_sine_waves_50_1000_3777hz` by invoking it
//! with different features (FFT implementations) enabled.

    /// normalization/scaling. Usually you calc the magnitude of each complex number on the
    /// resulting vector to get the amplitudes of the frequencies in the next step.
    ///
    /// ## Parameters
    /// * `samples` samples for FFT. Length MUST be a power of 2 for FFT, e.g. 1024 or 4096!

    /// implementations might be different here, because they may only have
    /// `N/2` results.
    ///
    /// The return value of this multiplied with `frequency_resolution` usually
    /// refers to the Nyquist frequency.

    /// For complex FFT we don't need the second half because it refers to
    /// negative frequency values (mirrored to first half with pos frequency values),
